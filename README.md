# learning-journal
This repository is my daily learning journal documenting my journey of rebuilding core programming and algorithmic skills. Each entry captures what I studied, problems solved, patterns practiced, and key insights gained. It reflects consistent growth in Java, logic building, and problem-solving discipline.
