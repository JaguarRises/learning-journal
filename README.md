📓 Learning Journal

This repository is a daily log of my journey in rebuilding strong programming and algorithmic foundations. Each entry documents the problems I solved, patterns I implemented, concepts I learned, and improvements in my problem-solving approach.

The purpose of this journal is to track consistency, reflect technical growth, and create a transparent proof of learning discipline.
