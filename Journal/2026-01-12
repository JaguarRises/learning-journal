🟢 Today I focused deeply on mastering any-base arithmetic operations in Java.

🟢 Skills Learned

Implemented correct any-base addition with carry propagation.

Understood and fixed borrow logic for any-base subtraction.

Designed full any-base multiplication using:

single-digit multiplication

shifting via place value

repeated any-base addition.

Debugged cascading borrow errors in base subtraction.

Built getProductWithSingleDigit() and integrated it into full multiplication.

Validated arithmetic across multiple bases and test cases.

🟢 Progress

Gained confidence in modelling low-level arithmetic algorithms.

Transitioned from trial-and-error coding to state-driven design.

Now fully understand how addition, subtraction and multiplication work internally across number systems.

🟢 Problems Solved
1. AnyBaseAddition
2. AnyBaseDifference
3. AnyBaseMultiplication
