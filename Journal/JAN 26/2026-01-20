Today I reinforced my Core Java fundamentals. I clarified the difference between String and char[], especially around immutability, security, memory, and performance. I practiced escape characters with char and understood how Java represents special characters. I learned the this keyword in depth—how it refers to the current object, resolves variable shadowing, and accesses instance state. I also debugged compilation issues related to Java’s case sensitivity and class/file rules. Overall, I made steady progress toward writing cleaner, more correct object‑oriented Java code and understanding the language beyond surface syntax.
