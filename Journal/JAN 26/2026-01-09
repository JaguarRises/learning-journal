Till now, I worked extensively on Java fundamentals and algorithmic thinking through pattern problems and number-theory utilities. I practiced modular function design (digit frequency, permutations nPr, GCD & LCM, prime factorization), handled edge cases, and improved input validation.

I implemented and refined complex pattern problems including diamond patterns, hollow structures, swastik (Pattern-19), W-pattern (Pattern-20), Fibonacci triangle, Floyd’s triangle, and multiple state-driven pattern engines. My focus shifted from formula-guessing to invariant-based and state-based modeling, making patterns predictable and debuggable.

I also improved my understanding of Euclid’s algorithm, digit extraction logic, permutation computation, and pattern geometry using coordinate conditions.

Overall, I strengthened my loop control, condition design, state evolution modeling, and algorithm clarity.
