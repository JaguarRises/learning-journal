Today I deepened my understanding of Java array memory behavior. I confirmed that assigning one array variable to another copies the reference, not the data, which explains shared modifications. I implemented a swap method and observed how passing arrays into methods allows in‑place updates due to pass‑by‑value of references. I reinforced array input/output loops and built a clear mental model of how references flow through my program.
