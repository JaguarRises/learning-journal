Today I reinforced key Core Java concepts by connecting syntax to underlying behavior. I practiced object-oriented thinking, clarified how method overloading works and how Java resolves calls at compile time, and solidified my understanding of stack vs heap memory, references, and object lifecycles. I resolved confusion around how data is passed to methods and why changes to arrays and objects persist. Overall, I made steady progress toward writing clearer, more intentional Java code with a stronger mental model of execution and memory.
