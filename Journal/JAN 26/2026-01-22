Focus: Java, IntelliJ IDEA, SDK & Language Levels

What I Learned

Understood the difference between Java language features and IntelliJ IDE behavior.

Learned that Java 21+ supports instance main() and unnamed classes, making public optional.

Realized that psvm expansion depends on Project SDK and Language Level, not Java itself.

Confirmed that Java 21 fully supports the classic public static void main(String[] args).

Problems Solved

Fixed psvm expanding to static void main() by:

Changing Project SDK to Java 17

Resetting IntelliJ’s expectations for modern Java features

Identified IDE inspections and templates as the root cause—not a Java error.

Progress Made

Gained confidence in debugging tooling vs language issues.

Built a clear mental model: Java defines what runs; IntelliJ defines what it suggests.

Established a stable setup for DSA and interview-oriented Java development.

Outcome

Environment is now predictable and aligned with learning goals.

Better control over IntelliJ configuration and Java versions.
