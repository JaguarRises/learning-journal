Skills Learned

Developed a robust algorithm for adding two numbers represented as digit arrays using pointer-based invariants.

Understood why right-aligned digit traversal (i, j, carry) is safer than length-difference logic.

Practiced designing invariant-safe loops: while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0).

Problems Solved

Refactored a fragile length-based addition approach into a clean, minimal solution.

Handled overflow carry without losing digits (e.g., 999 + 1 → 1000).

Simplified printing logic by separating arithmetic correctness from formatting concerns.

Progress Made

Moved from test-case-driven fixes to reasoning with loop invariants.

Gained confidence distinguishing works sometimes code from always correct algorithms.

Achieved a production-quality solution that is reusable, concise, and edge‑case safe.
