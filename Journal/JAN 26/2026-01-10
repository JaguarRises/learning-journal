Today I strengthened my understanding of number system conversions in Java. I realized why base-n numbers must be handled as strings instead of integers, especially when dealing with bases greater than 10 such as hexadecimal.

I fixed my DecimalToAny implementation to correctly support bases up to 36 by mapping digits greater than 9 to characters using ASCII logic. I also refactored AnyToDecimal to accept string input and parse characters properly, allowing conversion from any base to decimal without limitations.

This helped me clearly differentiate between numeric value computation and symbolic representation, which is critical in real-world systems.

Problems Solved:
1. DecimalToAny
2. AnyToDecimal
