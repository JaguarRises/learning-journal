Skills Learned

Understood polymorphism in depth, including compile-time (overloading) and runtime (overriding) polymorphism.

Learned how Dynamic Method Dispatch works and how the JVM resolves overridden methods at runtime.

Gained clarity on the final keyword—its use with variables, methods, and classes, and how it restricts polymorphism.

Learned about the Object class as the root of the Java class hierarchy and its key methods (toString, equals, hashCode, getClass).

Problems Solved / Concepts Clarified

Removed confusion between reference type vs object type in method calls.

Clearly differentiated == vs equals().

Understood why hashCode() must align with equals().

Connected final methods/classes to design and runtime behavior.

Progress Made

Moved from surface-level OOP understanding to runtime-level Java behavior.

Built a strong conceptual foundation of Core Java expected in interviews.

Increased confidence in reading, reasoning about, and explaining Java code.
