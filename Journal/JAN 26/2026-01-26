Skills learned

I strengthened my understanding of runtime polymorphism and how dynamic method dispatch works.

I reinforced the role of the Object class and its core methods in everyday Java design.

I clarified how the final keyword constrains inheritance and method overriding.

Problems solved

I eliminated confusion between reference type vs actual object during method calls.

I clearly separated == from equals() and understood the need to align equals() with hashCode().

I grasped why overriding toString() improves debugging and readability.

Progress made

I’m reasoning more at the JVM and runtime level, not just syntax.

My Core Java concepts feel more cohesive and interview-ready.

I’m gaining confidence explaining why Java behaves the way it does.
