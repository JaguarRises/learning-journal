What I learned

Strengthened my understanding of method overriding, including runtime polymorphism, dynamic method dispatch, and the rules around @Override, access modifiers, final, and static.

Learned how packages in Java organize code, prevent naming conflicts, and control access using visibility modifiers.

Gained a high-level understanding of JUnit 5 and its role in professional Java development and automated testing.

Problems I clarified

Resolved confusion between overriding vs overloading.

Understood how Java chooses overridden methods at runtime.

Connected package structure to real-world project organization.

Progress made

Moved from knowing OOP concepts to understanding how they work together in real applications.

Built confidence in Core Java fundamentals that are relevant for interviews and backend development.

Laid groundwork for moving into testing and structured project design.
