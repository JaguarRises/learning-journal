Skills Learned

Understood Lambda Expressions as a concise replacement for anonymous inner classes.

Implemented functional interfaces with:

void-returning lambdas (actions)

value-returning lambdas (computations).

Applied lambda syntax rules: type inference, single-expression simplification.

Learned Exception Handling fundamentals:

Difference between compile-time errors, runtime exceptions, and logical errors.

Exception hierarchy (Throwable → Exception → RuntimeException).

Checked vs unchecked exceptions.

Core constructs: try, catch, finally, throw, throws.

Problems Solved / Code Written

Implemented custom functional interfaces and provided lambda implementations.

Replaced anonymous inner classes with lambdas for cleaner, readable code.

Returned computed values using lambdas.

Conceptually handled runtime failures using structured exception handling.

Key Insights

Lambdas represent behavior, not objects with state.

Functional interfaces are the bridge between OOP and functional programming.

Exceptions are objects, propagate through the call stack, and integrate with OOP concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.

Progress Made

Transitioned confidently into modern Java (Java 8+) features.

Strengthened readiness for Streams API and Scala functional concepts.

Built a solid mental model connecting OOP, lambdas, and exception handling.
